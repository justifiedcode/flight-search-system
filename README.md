# Flight Search System

A working flight search system built with Hexagonal Architecture and asynchronous processing to aggregate results from multiple providers.

## The Problem

Users search for flights across multiple providers.
Each provider responds at different times and may fail independently.

The system:
- dispatches search requests to all providers
- collects responses asynchronously
- returns progressive results to the client

## User Interface

Users see results as soon as the first provider responds. Waiting for all sources is unacceptable.

### Core Components

- **Domain Core**: Pure business logic with zero infrastructure dependencies
- **Ports**: Interfaces that define contracts (Incoming & Outgoing)
- **Adapters**: Infrastructure implementations that plug into ports
- **Host**: Composition root that wires everything together

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **.NET 8 SDK** or later
- **Visual Studio 2022** or **VS Code** (optional)

### Running the Application

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd FlightSearch
   ```

2. **Build the solution**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

3. **Run the Host project**
   
```bash
   cd FlightSearch.Host
   dotnet run
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - **API**: http://localhost:49603 (Swagger UI)
   - **HTML Interface**: http://localhost:49603/flight-search.html or open the html file directly. Click the "Seach Flights" and watch the real-time progress.

## Simulation Notes

All flight providers are simulated.
Response delays and failure rates can be configured in appsettings.json.

## Architectural Reasoning

This repository shows the code structure and working implementation. The architectural reasoning behind this solution is documented in a separate PDF.
